* enter all links of the comics you want to download into the uppermost text field  
	(Links must be seperated by a line break)
>***Note:*** please don't use links of specific chapters  
>This would work: https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/hero-killer/list?title_no=2745  
>But this wouldn't: https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/hero-killer/episode-1/viewer?title_no=2745&episode_no=1  

>***Note2:*** To download Fan translations, add &language=LANGUAGE_CODE to the url
>Replace LANGUAGE_CODE with the language code of the desired translation
>For example:
>The url for dice is: https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/dice/list?title_no=64  
>To download the spanish fan translation, the url becomes: https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/dice/list?title_no=64&language=SPA  
>When multiple translations are found, the translation with highest likes is downloaded.
>If you are interested in downloading the translation of a specific team, add &teamVersion=TEAMVERSION to the url, replace TEAMVERSION with the desired team.

* Select a save folder by pressing the ***folder*** button  
* Check ***each catoon*** for the application to save all chapters of a cartoon under a common folder (***each chapter*** works likewise)  
###### There are multible ways chapters can be saved:  
* ***PDF file:***  every image of a given chapter is saved as a page in a PDF document. This results in one PDF file per chapter.
* ***CBZ file:***  chapters are saved as a Comic book archive file. Learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_archive).
* ***multiple images:***  every image is saved seperately. The number of images per chapter can vary.
* ***one image:***  every image of a given chapter is stitched together verically to create one very tall image per chapter.
###### Warning: if a chapter is so long that the resulting merged image exceeds 30,000 pixels in height it will be down scaled (in some cases even until the text isn't readable anymore). In those cases the PDF option may be better.   
* Now you can click the ***start*** button and wait (all controls should be deactivated until the download is done)
